## stubNull()
Returns the primitive value null.
```javascript
const lolite = require("lolite.stubnull")
console.log(lolite.stubNull()) // null
```

# EXTENDED DOCUMENTATION
LoLite contains some private utilities in its code that it uses internally. These are exported under the `__private` key in the default export. You probably don't want to use these, unless you have a really good reason to.

# lolite-browser
LoLite for browsers. Note: lolite browser support is in alpha, so this might not work.

## Usage
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/lolite-browser"></script>
<script>
  console.log(lolite.add(1, 2)) // 3
</script>
```
You can also use `lolite-browser` as a one-dependency replacement for the normal `lolite` package instead:
```js
const lolite = require("lolite-browser")
```
